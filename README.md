# United Way
24-25 Full-Stack Web & Mobile Project

Installation
Change directories into the repository `united-way`. Run the command `cd admin-portal && npm i && cd ../mobile && npm i && cd ../server && npm i`. This will directly install the requisite dependencies that are listed within `package.json` to be able to run the web and mobile applications, respectively.

Running
You should create two terminals, one based in the mobile directory AND/OR web directory (depending on the sprint being worked on) and one based in the server directory for running the server.

Then, run npm start in the server terminal and run npx expo start in the mobile terminal. Use the Expo Go App and the QR code to run the code on your mobile device.
